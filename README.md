The goal of hw04pchiyunliu is to calculate and plot the recursive
sequence n.

## Installation

You can install the released version of hw04pchiyunliu by asking me for
a copy.

``` r
install.packages("hw04pchiyunliu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(hw04pchiyunliu)
## basic example code
```

``` r
myseq_n(x = c(2, 4, 3), n = 5)
#> [1] 2.7
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
